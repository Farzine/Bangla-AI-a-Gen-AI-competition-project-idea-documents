# Bangla AI: A Gen AI Competition Project Idea

Welcome to the Bangla AI Gen AI competition project idea repository. This project aims to develop a Gen AI article headline generator model using machine learning and LLM (Large Language Model).

## Overview

The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to generate catchy and relevant article headlines in the Bengali language. By training a large language model on a dataset of Bengali articles, we aim to create a model capable of generating high-quality headlines that capture the essence of the article's content.

## Project Idea

The project idea involves building a machine learning model that can analyze the content of Bengali articles and generate relevant and engaging headlines. This will involve training a large language model on a dataset of Bengali text to learn patterns and relationships between article content and headline structure.

## Objectives

- Develop a large language model capable of understanding Bengali text.
- Train the model on a diverse dataset of Bengali articles to capture linguistic nuances.
- Implement a headline generation algorithm based on the learned patterns.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as headline relevance and engagement.

## Conclusion

The Bangla AI Gen AI competition project aims to explore the potential of machine learning and natural language processing techniques in generating high-quality article headlines in Bengali. By leveraging state-of-the-art language models and innovative algorithms, we aim to create a valuable tool for content creators and publishers in the Bengali-speaking community.
